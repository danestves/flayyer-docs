We are saying goodbye to `flayyer.io/v1` in favor of `flayyer.io/v2` which has:

* Smarter caching strategies
* Support for anti-fakenews via encrypted signatures
* Better handling of variables.

**No worries for you**, the legacy version was just being used by our early-early adopters and all them have migrated to v2.

We just released [@flayyer/cli@1.10.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flayyer/cli) which included additional CLI flags to allow developers specify their own directories and different deploy configurations.

Here is an example:

```sh title="Terminal.app"
flayyer build src --config flayyer.config.staging.js
flayyer deploy --dry
```
